## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because knowing it will be very efficient for me as a BSIS student. With this tool, I can manage my codes and know what is the current progress of my task. With Github, I can store my codes and also showcase it to the world. I can set up my profile as my portfolio to prove my skills and also to motivate myself to continue. It also allows collaboration with different peoples where we can make projects together and grow!
