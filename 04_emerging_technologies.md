#  Internet of Things (IoT)

## Purpose
The main purpose of IoT is to connect a multitude of devices and objects to the internet. This connectivity allows these devices to collect, share, and analyze information in real time. Additionally, IoT enables remote monitoring and control, making it possible for users to manage their systems from anywhere in the world.

## Usage
- **In Education**:  
Many schools across the US have implemented IoT-based security systems to improve safety. These systems typically include connected cameras, smart door locks, and motion detectors. They regulate building entry, allow security personnel to monitor areas remotely, and send instant alerts if suspicious activity is detected.

- **In IT**:  
 Leading as the most adopted IoT use case at 57.5% of organizations is process automation. This is a stark rise from the 33% adoption rate seen in the 2021 IoT use case report, where it was the second-ranked use case.
Process automation enables companies to streamline and automate processes by integrating interconnected devices and sensors with both new and legacy equipment, such as PLCs and IPCs. This use case helps to reduce the need for manual intervention, increasing efficiency, minimizing errors, and enhancing safety. Technologies such as IoT sensors and edge computing play a crucial role in enabling real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making. By incorporating IoT into existing systems, companies can optimize workflows, improve production quality, and implement predictive maintenance.

## Examples

- **In Education**:  
  For example, in **Schenectady, New York**, the City School District has installed security scanners at the high school entrances to improve safety. The system aims to detect weapons or prohibited items efficiently through walk-through metal detectors and smart bag scanners.

- **In IT**:  
  **Burnley Brewing**, an Australia-based craft brewery, approached its maximum capacity as demand for its beverages grew, it decided to expand. In doing so, it decided also to include automation in its processes. Burnley partnered with Australia-based contract electrical and engineering firm Bon Industry, which leveraged US-based industrial automation technology provider Rockwell Automation’s FactoryTalk Craft Brew—a process management and automation system developed specifically for the brewing industry. IoT sensors, PLCs, and other action-enabling hardware were placed throughout the brewing process, all connected to FactoryTalk Craft Brew for data collection and process actioning. As a result of this solution, Burnley Brewing lessened the labor of its brewers across the brewing process, from milling and mashing grain at the beginning to controlling fermenters and conditioning tanks near the end.
